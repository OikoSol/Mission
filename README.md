OikoSol Mission Statement

We believe in the development of affordable decentralized sustainable technologies, to enable families and individuals worldwide to gain more control and independence on their manufacturing power, their energy source, their food and water source and in their waste and wastewater treatment.

Such control and independence is necessary in the face of environmental degradation and resource scarcity. It is no longer a distant future concern, but rather an instant present one. A rational use of all of Earth’s finite resources is demanded, independent of its consequences to existing power structures.

We aim to create a repository of knowledge of localized sustainable technology, and everyone is welcome to spread, debate, criticize and improve on sustainable home technologies of the OikoSol website, and to make them accessible to everyone in the world with an internet access.

The end-goal will be to provide free DIY instructions that allow for most individuals or families, living in houses or apartments, to become as much energy, food & water, waste and transport independent as possible. The technologies in the instructions should be as conducive to life overall as possible, as well as affordable for individuals both in “developed” and “developing” countries.
