# Crowdfunding proposal (preliminary)

OikoSol is a personal project initially started in 2014 by Henrique SÃ¡nchez with the goal of creating a repository of free instructions for building technology to turn existing homes more self-sufficient in regards to energy production, water production, food production, waste treatment and individual transportation.

As a one-man project, progress has been slow due to lack of time and resources. The following crowdfunding proposal is an attempt to gather the funds necessary and to create the required incentives to promote the development of this project further.

This document will now go into detail about the specific mechanisms of how this crowdsale would be executed.

# Need for crowdfunding

The need for crowdfunding comes from a fundamental fact that, as a one-person part-time project I do not have the time and resources to perform the following necessary requirements in a timely manner:

1) Learning about all the different physical, chemical, and biological concepts for each target technology
2) Purchase materials for building prototypes
2) Testing different prototypes
3) Writing the instructions for all prototypes
4) Changing, improving past prototypes
5) Testing new prototypes after changes
6) Writing new instructions for new prototypes

Given the wide scope and the long list of target technologies, completing at least the first set of instructions for all target technologies (assuming they worked) would take years and some monetary resources.

Additionally, even if I could dedicate myself to this project full time and money/resources were not an issue, it would still take a formidable amount of time to execute all the primary mid-term goals. My initial response to this realization was to [create a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OikoSol/) community, promote the website and the concept as well as my work, and hope that others would be inspired to contribute as well since the project is open-source and free.

However, even after 3 years the feedback has been quite low and the level of engagement rather underwhelming. As such, I now believe that a monetary incentive could be the key in accelerating user engagement.

# Mechanism of crowdfunding

(token, erc20, smart contract, voting rights, liquidity, funds for development rewards)

While I have some money to be able to tinker and experiment in some projects, I don't have the necessary amounts to be able to just afford all the materials and tools required to try and build at least one prototype for all the target technologies. As stated before, I also don't have the time to engage in it full-time at the moment.

As such, the idea behind the crowdfunding would be to collect funds and have them serve as financial rewards for those experimenting with and submitting instructions following our soleco template. Those supplying the funds, in return for supporting the project for their own personal reasons, would receive a blockchain token that would enable them to vote on how the funds get distributed.

The importance of distributing the power to decide who receives the funds and who has access to the funds is instrumental in ensuring that:

1) Me or any other individual person doesn't have the sole power over (and thus an incentive) to take the collected funds and run with them, and;
2) Me or any other individual person don't express any bias in rewarding the funds other than on the submitter meeting the requirements and receiving them by merit.

Another advantage of choosing to supply the voting rights via a blockchain token is that if the original supporters decide they are no longer interested in voting on how the funds are rewarded, they can exchange said ownership in an open market with liquidity to other future supporters. The price of the token would be irrelevant to the voting since the voting weight is determined by the number of tokens relative to the total supply.

More importantly, the ideal scenario would be that funds collected would be locked in a smart contract, releasable only by a sufficient number of token holders signing messages that the funds could be sent to a corresponding address (or delegating said responsability), and the funds maintaining a stable value throughout the period in which they are being distributed.

One platform that would enable the crowdfunding, smart contract creation and execution, voting via signing messages, and liquitiy in exchanging the token for other assets, is the Ethereum platform. The Oikosol token would then likely be an ERC20 type asset.
