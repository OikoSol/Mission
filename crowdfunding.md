# Crowdfunding proposal (preliminary)

OikoSol is a personal project initially started in 2014 by Henrique SÃ¡nchez with the goal of creating a repository of free instructions for building technology to turn existing homes more self-sufficient in regards to energy production, water production, food production, waste treatment and individual transportation.

As a one-man project, progress has been slow due to lack of time and resources. The following crowdfunding proposal is an attempt to gather the funds necessary and to create the required incentives to promote the development of this project further.

This document will now go into detail about the specific mechanisms of how this crowdsale would be executed.

# Need for crowdfunding

(lack of time resources for reasonable development progress)

# Mechanism of crowdfunding

(token, erc20, smart contract, voting rights, liquidity, funds for development rewards)

# Rewards proposal

(allocation per project/topic)
