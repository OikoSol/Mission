# Crowdfunding proposal (Initial Draft)

OikoSol is a personal project initially started in 2014 by Henrique Sánchez with the goal of creating a repository of free instructions for building technology to turn existing homes more self-sufficient in regards to energy production, water production, food production, waste treatment and individual transportation. Henrique Sánchez is a sanitation and environment engineer which has worked in several organizations and companies (Grönare Stad AB, Hemmaodlat, Veolia Water Technologies) in developing food production and wastewater treatment technologies.

As a one-man project, progress has been slow due to individual lack of time and resources. The following crowdfunding proposal is an attempt to gather the funds necessary and to create the required incentives to promote the development of this project further.

This document will now go into detail about the specific mechanisms of how this crowdsale would be executed.

# Need for crowdfunding

The need for crowdfunding comes from a fundamental fact that, as a one-person part-time project I do not have the time and resources to perform the following necessary requirements in a timely manner:

1) Learning about all the different physical, chemical, and biological concepts for each target technology
2) Purchase materials for building prototypes
2) Testing different prototypes
3) Writing the instructions for all prototypes
4) Changing, improving past prototypes
5) Testing new prototypes after changes
6) Writing new instructions for new prototypes

Given the wide scope and the long list of target technologies, completing at least the first set of instructions for all target technologies (assuming they worked) would take years and some monetary resources.

Additionally, even if I could dedicate myself to this project full time and money/resources were not an issue, it would still take a formidable amount of time to execute all the primary mid-term goals. My initial response to this realization was to [create a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OikoSol/) community, promote the website and the concept as well as my work, and hope that others would be inspired to contribute as well since the project is open-source and free.

However, even after 3 years the feedback has been quite low and the level of engagement rather underwhelming. As such, I now believe that a monetary incentive could be the key in accelerating user engagement.

# Mechanism of crowdfunding

While I have some money to be able to tinker and experiment in some projects, I don't have the necessary amounts to be able to just afford all the materials and tools required to try and build at least one prototype for all the target technologies. As stated before, I also don't have the time to engage in it full-time at the moment.

As such, the idea behind the crowdfunding would be to collect funds and have them serve as financial rewards for those experimenting with and submitting instructions following our soleco template. Those supplying the funds, in return for supporting the project for their own personal reasons, would receive a blockchain token that would enable them to vote on how the funds get distributed.

The importance of distributing the power to decide who receives the funds and who has access to the funds is instrumental in ensuring that:

1) Me or any other individual person doesn't have the sole power over (and thus an incentive) to take the collected funds and run with them, and;
2) Me or any other individual person don't express any bias in rewarding the funds other than on the submitter meeting the requirements and receiving them by merit.

Another advantage of choosing to supply the voting rights via a blockchain token is that if the original supporters decide they are no longer interested in voting on how the funds are rewarded, they can exchange said ownership in an open market with liquidity to other future supporters. The price of the token would be irrelevant to the voting since the voting weight is determined by the number of tokens in each vote relative to the total supply, with a vote being passed if >50% of all tokens voted in favor.

More importantly, the ideal scenario would be that funds collected would be locked in a smart contract, releasable only by a sufficient number of token holders signing messages that the funds could be sent to a corresponding address (or delegating said responsability), and the funds maintaining a stable value throughout the period in which they are being distributed (perhaps by only enabling contributions via stablecoin projects such as DAI).

One platform that would enable the crowdfunding, smart contract creation and execution, voting via signing messages, and liquitiy in exchanging the token for other assets, is the Ethereum platform. The Oikosol token would then likely be an ERC20 type asset.

# Rewards proposal

The crowdfunding event has as a goal to collect an absolute maximum of $44 825 and issue an absolute maximum of 1 000 000 OSL/OIK tokens, during the period of 30 days (to be determined).

The crowdfunding event has three milestones depending on the amount of funds collected: 

* First milestone: Funding at least one instruction for all current listed technologies without instructions (21 instructions, requiring $1575)
* Second milestone: Funding all instruction goals for all currently listed technologies, fixing both performance issues and design issues (71 instructions, requiring $12325)
* Third milestone: Funding for all instruction goals and further Oikosol development goals including: In-website prototyping tool, instructions for multi-functional technologies, instructions for automating existing technologies, partnership deals with future homes that want to integrate the Oikosol open-source technologies, a website restructuring & hosting, a possible rebranding, video instructions for the existing instruction list, funds for future technology instructions not listed, and funds for researching and developing instructions for a bioprinter. ($44825)

Within each milestone the rewards are distributed as following:

Please notice how the first instructions marked "Reserved" are not eligible for rewards since I am currently working in their development.

Also notice how in the Others section, it is detailed in the "comments" column how the funds are distributed within that sub-category.

The tokens will be distributed after the crowdfunding event has ended. If the number of funds exceeds any milestone goal, the excess funds will be returned to the
