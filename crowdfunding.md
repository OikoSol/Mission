# Crowdfunding proposal (preliminary)

OikoSol is a personal project initially started in 2014 by Henrique SÃ¡nchez with the goal of creating a repository of free instructions for building technology to turn existing homes more self-sufficient in regards to energy production, water production, food production, waste treatment and individual transportation.

As a one-man project, progress has been slow due to lack of time and resources. The following crowdfunding proposal is an attempt to gather the funds necessary and to create the required incentives to promote the development of this project further.

This document will now go into detail about the specific mechanisms of how this crowdsale would be executed.

# Need for crowdfunding

(lack of time resources for reasonable development progress)

The need for crowdfunding comes from a fundamental fact that, as a one-person part-time project I do not have the time and resources to perform the following necessary requirements in a timely manner:
1) Learning about all the different physical, chemical, and biological concepts for each target technology
2) Purchase materials for building prototypes
2) Testing different prototypes
3) Writing the instructions for all prototypes
4) Changing, improving past prototypes
5) Testing new prototypes after changes
6) Writing new instructions for new prototypes

Given the wide scope and the long list of target technologies, completing at least the first set of instructions for all target technologies (assuming they worked) would takes years and some monetary resources.

Additionally, even if I could dedicate myself to this project full time and money/resources were not an issue, it would still take a formidable amount of time to execute all the primary mid-term goals. My initial response to this realization was to [create a subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OikoSol/) community, promote the website and the concept as well as my work, and hope that others would be inspired to contribute as well since the project is open-source and free.

However, even after 3 years the feedback has been quite low and the level of engagement rather underwhelming. As such, I now believe that a monetary incentive could be the key in accelerating user engagement.
