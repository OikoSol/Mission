OikoSol Mission Statement

We believe in the development of affordable decentralized sustainable technologies, to enable ourselves and other interested individuals worldwide to gain more control and independence in their manufacturing power, their energy source, their food and water source and in their waste and wastewater treatment.

Such control and independence is necessary as we believe in the right to self-sufficiency, independently of its consequences to existing power structures and distribution networks. We believe that only when every individual has fulfilled their basic physical needs can they be free to peacefully cooperate with others from a position of equal power.

We aim to create a repository of knowledge of localized sustainable technology, where everyone is welcome to spread, debate, criticize and improve on sustainable home technologies of the OikoSol repository.

The end-goal will be to provide free DIY instructions that allow for most individuals or families, living in houses or apartments, to become as much energy, food & water, waste and transport independent as possible. The technologies in the instructions should be as conducive to life overall as possible, as well as affordable for all individuals globally.
